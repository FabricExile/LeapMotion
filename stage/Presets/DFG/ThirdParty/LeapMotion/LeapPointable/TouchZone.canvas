The Leap\n* Motion software interprets purposeful movements toward this plane as potential touch\n* points. When a Pointable moves close to the adaptive touch plane, it enters the\n* \"hovering\" zone. When a Pointable reaches or passes through the plane, it enters\n* the \"touching\" zone.\n\n* The possible states are present in the Zone enum of this class:\n\n* **Zone.NONE** -- The Pointable is outside the hovering zone.\n\n* **Zone.HOVERING** -- The Pointable is close to, but not touching the touch plane.\n\n* **Zone.TOUCHING** -- The Pointable has penetrated the touch plane.\n\n* The touchDistance value provides a normalized indication of the distance to\n* the touch plane when the Pointable is in the hovering or touching zones.\n\n* \\include Pointable_touchZone.txt\n\n* @returns The touch zone of this Pointable\n* @since 1.0\n\nSupported types:\n  this: LeapPointable\n  result: UInt32\n"
