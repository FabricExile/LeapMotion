The value 1.0 indicates the\n* Pointable is at the far edge of the hovering zone. The value 0 indicates the\n* Pointable is just entering the touching zone. A value of -1.0 indicates the\n* Pointable is firmly within the touching zone. Values in between are\n* proportional to the distance from the plane. Thus, the touchDistance of 0.5\n* indicates that the Pointable is halfway into the hovering zone.\n\n* \\include Pointable_touchDistance.txt\n\n* You can use the touchDistance value to modulate visual feedback given to the\n* user as their fingers close in on a touch target, such as a button.\n\n* @returns The normalized touch distance of this Pointable object.\n* @since 1.0\n\n\n Supported by LeapPointable"
