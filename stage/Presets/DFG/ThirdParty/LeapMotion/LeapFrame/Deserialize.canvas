For example, calling ``gestures(sinceFrame)`` on a\n* deserialized frame or with a deserialized frame as parameter (or both)\n* does not necessarily return all gestures that occured between the two\n* frames. Motion functions, like ``scaleFactor(startFrame)``, are more\n* likely to return reasonable results, but could return anomalous values\n* in some cases.\n\n* @since 2.1.0\n\n\n Supported by LeapFrame"
